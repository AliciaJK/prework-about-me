      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my page! I am a Cognitive Science graduate from Carleton university in 2019. I was working in the aviation technology industry in 2020 when the pandemic started and shortly after found myself looking for a career change. So as we all do after a "forced career change" we order chineese food and eat the fortune cookie. Mine said "Your dreams are never silly, depend on them to guide you" and that alone inspired me to go back to school, change fields and learn something that will make me irreplacable with my combined knowledge of aviation. So here I am!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Ottawa Canada</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to curl and ski. I curl competitively out of the Ottawa curling club. I love to craft and I make cards, (check out my card making business (@CardsByAliK)). While I am not making cards or curling, you can find me out at the park with my Australian Cattle dog, Cali.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>After spending a summer down in the heart of Silicon Valley California, I fell in love. In love with the state, the ocean, the rolling hill and most importantly the knowledge and speed of the Silicon Valley culture. My dream job would be to work for a large company making intense headway into the Aviation-Technology sector. Like Google X, Prime Air, Uber Elevate or many of the feeder compagnies or start ups that will grow into the aviation-tech area.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently still live in Ottawa, I stayed at home while going to University and found work here and it will always be home.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because I want to invoke change in the world - through technology. I want to be irreplacable to a company and I want to take the next steps in my career even before it begins. I am setting myself up for the rest of my life and I am so glad I made this decision now. </p>
